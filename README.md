# WeatherAnalysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a data set containing weather data form multiple European stations. The code performs data aggregation and visualization to provide information onto numerous weather measurements including precipitation and temperature.

The script generates several bar plots and histograms to visualize the data. For instance, mean precipitation and temperature across various stations are displayed in bar charts, and histograms are used to show monthly precipitation distributions for each station.

## Future Work
In the future, there are plants to train a model to predict temperature and weather in the city of Basal.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains various weather-related measurements from multiple European stations. The data columns include temperature (min, max, mean), pressure, wind speed, precipitation, cloud cover, global radiation, humidity, sunshine duration, and wind gusts.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```
